# Superstore_Profit_Loss
### Project Goal
A data set was obtained and an overarching message needed to be conveyed using graphs in a poster display. This was 
important to use appropriate color schemes and spacing along with designing it to catch the eye 
in particular sections. 
### Data
The data set was obtained from kaggle about Superstore, a chain of stores 
that sell items such as electronics, furniture, and office supplies. There were areas where the 
business was losing money. These areas were identified and using visualizations, the where, 
what, and why of profit loss was shown. The data was grouped and transformed in R using 
ggplot followed by it being exported and edited in adobe illustrator.
### R code for visualizations
Simple graphs were created using R a few examples are below.

### Poster creation using Adobe Illustrator
Using Adobe Illustrator, a poster was created setting different layers including a layout, background, headers, text, and one for each plot.  The plots were edited to be eye catching and match the overarching flow of the poster.
